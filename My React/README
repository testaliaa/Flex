Read Me:
In this code, I am defining a React component called SearchableList that takes a prop called items. Items is an 
array composed of strings representing a list of items to search through.

The component uses the useState hook to declare a state variable called searchTerm.
At first, searchTerm is set to an empty string. Eventually, this variable will be assigned to the user's search term. 

Next I defined a function called handleSearchChange that is called whenever the user types something into the search input. 
This duty of this function is to update the searchTerm state variable to whatever the user input ends up being. 

The component then filters the items array based on whether each item includes the current search term (ignoring case). 
This filtered list is stored in the filteredItems variable.

Finally, the component displays an input field and a list of items that match the current search term. 
The input field is bound to the searchTerm state variable, so whenever the user types something into the input,
the handleSearchChange function is called and the list is filtered accordingly.

This code uses a combination of JavaScript and React to implement a simple search feature that updates in real-time as the user types. 
By using React's state and rendering capabilities, the component automatically updates the list of items whenever the search term changes, 
without needing to manually update the DOM.
